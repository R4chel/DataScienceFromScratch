# DataScienceFromScratch
The exercises and examples from Data Science From Scratch by Joel Grus in Jupyter notebooks with examples done using Bokeh.
Most of the code is from the book and was written by Joel Grus (http://joelgrus.com/) and his version of the code from the book is (https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch).
This is what I am creating as I go through the book and attempt to learn the material and Bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).
